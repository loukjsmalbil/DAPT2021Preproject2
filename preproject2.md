# Mini-project 2

## Overview

The goal of this miniproject is to find and acquire data. Ideally, you should be able to use these data for the next (data visualisation) project. 

---

## Technical Requirements

The technical requirements for this project are as follows:

 - Come up with a research question and some corresponding hypotheses. 
 - Find data with which you might be able to answer your question. 
 - In total, you will have to find data using the following three sources:
    - A csv/excel sheet from the internet (e.g. Kaggle/Google/ML Repository etc.). 
    - API.
    - Raw HTML (webscraping). 
 - The data must be stored in your local database (not just as comma separated files!). 
 - The data should be clean and ready to use. 

## Necessary Deliverables

The following deliverables should be pushed to your branch:

- **A Jupyter notebook** constaining the basic cleaning procedures and a link to your local database.  
- **A presentation** in which you explain your RQ, where you got the data from, how you cleaned it and how you expect you use it to answer your questions. 
- **An empty data folder** with a read me file inside that explains the data sets.
- **DATA** Please do not upload any data to the repository but place a link to the data in your jupyter notebook as we usually do 
  You can then ask the reader in the notebook to download the data and place them locally in the provided empty data folder. The link in the notebook can point to the original data set or to our google drive [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1D1iseKNOy50mqo31FkuQbID-zfCyijZD?usp=sharing) where you can store the data. The exact raw data set you used should be linked. 


## Resources and suggestions

* **Find a data set to process** <br>
A great place to start looking would be <br>
[Awesome Public Data Sets](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets)<br> 
[Kaggle Data Sets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)<br>
[UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)<br> 
A great new source is the <br> [Google dataset search](https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch)
* **Resources for Markdown in Jupyter** <br>
    * [Short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBCB23pQeIA)
    * [Article](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/the-jupyter-notebook-formatting-guide-873ab39f765e)
    * You may also find inspiration from the jupyter notebooks you have worked on for your labs
    

## Useful questions to ask yourself

* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

* __Creativity__: Did you add a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you incorporate domain knowledge or unique perspective into your analysis

* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class?


This will be useful as an overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are described in the specs above__, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!

## Presentation Guideline and Criteria

### Format

* Presentation Time: 10 minutes max
* Q & A: 5 minutes
* **Total Time:** 15 minutes

### Outputs

* Present your findings using the Jupyter notebook you have developed, **no slides and no power point presentation**
* Be prepared to explain your entire notebook guiding us trough your thought process

### Things to talk about

* Introduction
  * Describe the datasets you chose
  * Why did you choose that dataset?
  * The most important thing you learned
* The code
    * Be prepared to explain your code as well as markdown comments 
* Challenges
    * What was the most challenging part about this miniproject?
